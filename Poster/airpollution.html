          <p>
            - <b> Air pollution</b> is caused by solid and liquid particles and
            <br />
            certain gases that are suspended in the air. These particles and
            <br />
            gases can come from car and truck exhaust, factories, dust, <br />
            pollen, mold spores, volcanoes and wildfires. <br />
            The solid and liquid particles suspended in our air are called
            aerosols. <br />
            <br />
            Air pollution happens when solid and liquid particles—called
            aerosols—and <br />
            certain gases end up in our air. These particles and gases can be
            bad for the <br />
            planet and for our health, so keeping track of them is important.
